// Complete each of the following exercises.
// for loop
// Use a for loop to console.log each item in the array carsInReverse.
const carsInReverse = ['acura','jeep','mercedes','dodge'];

for (var i = 0; i < carsInReverse.length; i ++){
  console.log(i);
}

// for...in loop
// Create an object (an array with keys and values) called persons with the following data:
// firstName: "Jane"
// lastName: "Doe"
// birthDate: "Jan 5, 1925"
// gender: "female"
// Use a for...in loop to console.log each key.
// Then use a for...in loop and if state to console.log the value associated with the key birthDate.
// while loop
// Use a for loop to console.log the numbers 1 to 1000.
// do...while loop
// Use a do...while loop to console.log the numbers from 1 to 1000.
// When is a for loop better than a while loop?
// /in general a while loop is used if you want an action to repeat itself until a certain condition is met i.e. if statement. 
// /An for loop is used when you want to iterate through an object. i.e. iterate through an array.
// // How is the readability of the code affected?
// What is the difference between a for loop and a for...in loop?
// What is the difference between a while loop and a do...while loop?
